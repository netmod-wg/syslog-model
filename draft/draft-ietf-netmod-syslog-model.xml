    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration of a
      syslog process. It is intended this model be used by vendors who
      implement syslog in their systems.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines a YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/>
 configuration
      data model that may be used to configure the syslog feature running on a
      system.  YANG models can be used with network management protocols
      such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>
 to install, manipulate, and
      delete the configuration of network devices.</t>

    <t>The data model makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows
      implementations to support only those syslog features that lie within
      their capabilities.</t>

    <t>This module can be used to configure the syslog application conceptual
      layers as implemented on the target system.</t>

    <t>Essentially, a syslog process receives messages (from the kernel,
      processes, applications or other syslog processes) and processes them.
      The processing may involve logging to a local file, and/or displaying on
      console, and/or relaying to syslog processes on other machines. The
      processing is determined by the "facility" that originated the message
      and the "severity" assigned to the message by the facility.</t>

    <t>Such definitions of syslog protocol are defined in 
      <xref target="RFC5424"/>
, and are used in this RFC.</t>

    <t>The YANG model in this document conforms to the Network Management
      Datastore Architecture defined in 
      [RFC8342].</t>

: a "relay"
        forwards messages, accepting messages from originators or other relays
        and sending them to collectors or other relays</t>

  <t>The term "collectors" is defined in <xref target="RFC5424"/>
: a
        "collector" gathers syslog content for further analysis.</t>

  <t>The term "action" refers to the processing that takes place for

<section title="Design of the Syslog Model">
<t>The syslog model was designed by comparing various syslog features
      implemented by various vendors' in different implementations.</t>

<t>This document addresses the common leafs between implementations and
      creates a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
      features, if necessary. This model is designed to be very simple for
      maximum flexibility.</t>

<t>Some optional features are defined in this document to specify
      functionality that is present in specific vendor configurations.</t>

<t>Syslog consists of originators and collectors. The following diagram
      shows syslog messages flowing from originators, to collectors where
      filtering can take place.</t>

  <postamble>Figure 1. Syslog Processing Flow</postamble>
</figure>

<t>Collectors are configured using the leaves in the syslog model
      "actions" container which correspond to each message collector:</t>

<t>
  <list style="empty">
    <t>console</t>

    <t>log file(s)</t>

    <t>remote relay(s)/collector(s)</t>
  </list>
</t>

<t>Within each action, a selector is used to filter syslog messages. A
      selector consists of a list of one or more filters specified by
      facility-severity pairs, and, if supported via the select-match feature,
      an optional regular expression pattern match that is performed on the <xref target="RFC5424"/>
 field.</t>

<t>A syslog message is processed if: <figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[
       There is an element of facility-list (F, S) where
           the message facility matches F
           and the message severity matches S
       and/or the message text matches the regex pattern (if it 
           is present)
       ]]>  </artwork>
</figure>
</t>

<t>The facility is one of a specific syslog-facility, or all
      facilities.</t>

<t>The severity is one of type syslog-severity, all severities, or none.
      None is a special case that can be used to disable a filter. When
      filtering severity, the default comparison is that messages of the
      specified severity and higher are selected to be logged. This is shown
      in the model as "default equals-or-higher". This behavior can be altered
      if the select-adv-compare feature is enabled to specify a compare
      operation and an action. Compare operations are: "equals" to select
      messages with this single severity, or "equals-or-higher" to select
      messages of the specified severity and higher. Actions are used to log
      the message, block the message, or stop the message from being logged.</t>

<t>Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in
      their implementation. An example is included in Extending Facilities
      (Appendix A.1).</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.</t>

<t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
      These data nodes should be considered sensitive or vulnerable in all
      network environments.  Logging in particular is used to assess the state of 
      systems and can be used to indicate a network compromise.  If logging were 
      to be disabled through malicious means, attacks may not be readily detectable.  
      Therefore write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data
      nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
      operations and on network security.</t>

<t>In addition there are data nodes that require careful analysis and
      review. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
<t hangText="   facility-filter/pattern-match:">When writing this
          node, implementations MUST ensure that the regular expression
          pattern match is not constructed to cause a regular expression
          denial of service attack due to a pattern that causes the regular
          expression implementation to work very slowly (exponentially related
          to input size).</t>

<t hangText="   remote/destination/signing/cert-signer:">When
          writing this subtree, implementations MUST NOT specify a private key
          that is used for any other purpose.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
      notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
      and their sensitivity/vulnerability: <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
<t hangText="   remote/destination/transport:">This subtree contains
          information about other hosts in the network, and the TLS transport
          certificate properties if TLS is selected as the transport
          protocol.</t>

<t hangText="   remote/destination/signing:">This subtree contains
          information about the syslog message signing properties including
          signing certificate information.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>There are no RPC operations defined in this YANG module.</t>

<t>Terminal output with requirements more complex than the console
  subtree currently provides, are expected to be supported via vendor
  extensions rather than handled via the file subtree.</t>
</section>
<section title="Syslog File Naming Convention">
<t>The syslog/file/log-file/file-rotation container contains
  configuration parameters for syslog file rotation.  This section
  describes how these fields might be used by an implementer to name
  syslog files in a rotation process.  This information is offered as	
  an informative guide only.</t>

<t>When an active syslog file with a name specified by log-file/name,
  reaches log-file/max-file-size and/or syslog events arrive after the
  period specified by log-file/rollover, the logging system can close	
  the file, can compress it, and can name the archive file &lt;log-file/
  name>.0.gz.  The logging system can then open a new active syslog
  file &lt;log-file/name>.</t>

<t>When the new syslog file reaches either of the size limits referenced	
  above, &lt;log-file/name>.0.gz can be renamed &lt;log-file/name>.1.gz and
  the new syslog file can be closed, compressed and renamed &lt;log-file/
  name>.0.gz.  Each time that a new syslog file is closed, each of the
  prior syslog archive files named &lt;log-file/name>.&lt;n>.gz can be
  renamed to &lt;log-file/name>.&lt;n + 1>.gz.</t>

<t>Removal of archive log files could occur when either or both:</t>

<t>- log-file/number-of-files specified - the logging system can create
  up to log-file/number-of-files syslog archive files after which, the
  contents of the oldest archived file could be overwritten.</t>

<t>- log-file/retention specified - the logging system can remove those	
  syslog archive files whose file expiration time (file creation time
  plus the specified log-file/retention time) is prior to the current
  time.</t>
